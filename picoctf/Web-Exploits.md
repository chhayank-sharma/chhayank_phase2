# 1. Web Gauntlet

## Description:

Can you beat the filters? Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:55619/ http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:55619/filter.php

## Solution:

In this challenge, we have been provided with two links. The first one has `username` and `password` entry fields whereas the 2nd one shows the input filters that have been put into place.

If we enter `username=admin` and `password=admin`, then in the background, we will be able to see the whole expression: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='admin'`.

For round 1, in the `username` field, we can put `admin'--` and then put anythin in the password field. This same input will work in round 2 and round 3 as well.

For round 4, the word `admin` is also being filtered. Thus, we need to somehow concatenate two different strings to make up `admin`. To do this, I did a google search of how to concatenate strings in SQL and found that there were 2 methods depending on which SQL backend was being used. `SQL Server` and `MySQL` use the `+` operator whereas `Oracle`, `PostgreSQL` and `SQLite` use the `||` operator.

First, I tried entering `ad'+'min';`, but it didnt work

Then, I tried entering `a'+'dmin';` and it worked. The same input will also work in round 5.

This shows us that the SQL backend is either `Oracle`, `PostgreSQL` or `SQLite`. The flag can be captured on the filters website.

# 2. SSTI1

## Description:

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out! I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website [here](http://rescued-float.picoctf.net:57481/)!

## Solution:

In this challenge, we have been provided with a link to a website which announces anything we write in the text box back to us.

From the challenge title and the given hint, we can see that we have to use `Server Side Template Injection` to get the flag. To confirm this, we can put in a demo input of `{{2+2}}` to see if the vulnerability is present. If the vulnerability is present, the site should announce 4 instead of `{{2+2}}`.

As we can confirm, the exploit seems to work. Now, we can start probing around in the enviroment to try and find the flag. we can start by listing all the files in the current directory using the prompt `{{cycler.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('ls').read()}}`

In the output, we can see that the flag file is present in the current directory itself. We can then print it using the prompt `{{cycler.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat flag').read()}}`.

This will give us the flag picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_f5438664}.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_f5438664}

# 3. Cookies

## Description:

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. [http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/)

## Solution:

In this challenge, we have been provided with a website that has a textbox where we can enter the name of a cookie and it will rate it.

If we enter inspection mode, and go to the cookies, we can see a cookie called `name`. On entering some random input, we can see that the `value` field of the `name` cookie gets updated. For an invalid input, the `value` seems to become -1.

If we manually change the `value` to something different like 0 and then reload the page, we can see that the website will update to a different cookie.

We can try to bruteforce the website by entering all values starting from 0.

As we keep doing this, at `value=18`, the flag will be printed.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Something about cookies ig
