## Description:

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out! I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website [here](http://rescued-float.picoctf.net:57481/)!

## Solution:

In this challenge, we have been provided with a link to a website which announces anything we write in the text box back to us.

From the challenge title and the given hint, we can see that we have to use `Server Side Template Injection` to get the flag. To confirm this, we can put in a demo input of `{{2+2}}` to see if the vulnerability is present. If the vulnerability is present, the site should announce 4 instead of `{{2+2}}`.

As we can confirm, the exploit seems to work. Now, we can start probing around in the enviroment to try and find the flag. we can start by listing all the files in the current directory using the prompt `{{cycler.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('ls').read()}}`

In the output, we can see that the flag file is present in the current directory itself. We can then print it using the prompt `{{cycler.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat flag').read()}}`.

This will give us the flag picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_f5438664}.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_f5438664}
